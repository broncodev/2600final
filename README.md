#**CS2600 Final Project: BlackJack Game!**

##**Overview**
This is a terminal-based BlackJack game written in C, which allows a user to play against a dealer with support for standard BlackJack features like hitting, standing, and hand splitting. The game supports up to four player hands (due to splitting) and includes realistic scoring mechanics with Ace handling.

###**How To Play**:
- **START**: Type s to start game.
- **HELP**: Type h for instructions.
- **QUIT**: Type q to quit game.
- During each turn:
    Type h to hit (draw another card).
    Type s to stand (end your turn for that hand).
    Type | to split a pair into two hands (if allowed).

###**Game Mechanics** **
Cards are randomly drawn with values from 1 (Ace) to 10. The dealer starts with one card. Each player hand starts with two cards. After all hands are played, dealer reveals hand and draws until score is at least 17.
